### Hi, I’m Pius 👋

I’m a backend-oriented software engineer working mainly with Python and Node.js. I build RESTful APIs and backend systems with a focus on reliability, security, and clean architecture.

I enjoy solving backend problems such as data modeling, API design, and debugging subtle issues in systems. I’m particularly interested in developer tools, productivity software, and consumer products that have real-world impact.

I’m currently learning FastAPI and deepening my understanding of backend system design.
